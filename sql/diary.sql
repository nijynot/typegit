Think of how many believe conspiracy theories, they\'re being contrarian, but not right. The value of being a contrarian is when you\'re contrarian and right. You have some secret that not many else know about. In other words you have an information advantage over everyone else, it might seem trivial, but I guarantee you it\'s not. If you have experienced AirBnB early on, you would have a information advantage. If you knew about the startup culture, or phenomenon, you would have an information advantage career wise. You would know that it\'s a path in life.\n\nIt\'s also useful for investments, it goes back to that you want to be there when there\'s no money, and get out when there is. [1] For this, you obviously need an information advantage.\n\nThis can be generalized to taking advantage of your advantages. Same with how people play League of Legends. You win by taking advantage of properties of the game that your opponent doesn\'t know about. A secret so to say.\n\nAlso note that being contrarian is a property w.r.t. time.

If you do, how is it then a gift? Of course you can call it a discount gift, but that feel non genuine. That\'s why one should only gift free things, i.e. without strings attached.\n\nIf you get gifted without strings attached first where the receiver accepts and thanks, it\'s the usual nice gift. Nothing wrong. But if the gifter after changes their mind and apply strings attached, what was the receiver\'s thanking for? It makes the receiver seem petty while the gifter generous, while that\'s not really the case. In that case the gifter is actually selling something at discount, not gifting. He\'s can still be generous depending on price, but it\'s not the same as gifting generous. The item being sold has different value for different people.\n\nThis is what\'s so weird about this situation. The receiver ends up looking petty even though it\'s the gifter who changes their mind, even after it was already gifted. That is, going back on their words.\n\nIf the item was first pitched as a item for discount, it would not be seen as non genuine as much, but just as a if you want, I can sell, which is totally fine.

Black, Hispanic founders are in the minority, thus inequality. A common counter argument is that it\'s not a problem because it\'s their own choice. I don\'t believe this to be true though. If the percentage of minority race founders are very, very low, it\'s reasonable to assume that it\'s not by chance. Because it\'s like saying they have chosen to not want a better life, rationally, they should want money and a better career.\n\nThus, if we assume that they would choose the better option, as it clearly is better, why don\'t they? This is because of how society is structured and is biased against them. We all have biases and just think about the memes on internet, e.g. take KFC, you can possibly link it with black people. Not that you wanted to, but because of the memes and biases. The stereotype problem so to say.\n\nSo it can be said that society is built against them, they are less likely to do valuable things as it\'s seen as odd for them to do it. They have to exert more force and against pressure, biases, first impressions, and all of that if they want to succeed, if they even start. The society is against their start, so many don\'t even try.\n\nThis is why it\'s a problem, and it\'s not weird for us, non-minority people to want to solve it, I mean, it\'s a real problem, why don\'t you want to solve it? Because they will *take our jobs*, I mean come one. Do you wan to suppress the minority and trash equality because you\'re afraid they\'ll take your future? Then work harder, it\'s as easy as that.\n\nWho doesn\'t want a job in tech? You earn a lot by writing code. Google. Apple. All of that.\n\nIt\'s not a coincidence that minority race is a less than minority in lucrative jobs. It\'s biases and other components that are against them.\n\nSame can be said about women in tech, and outside of tech, but not as much.','2017-12-06 22:29:37',1),('VZyLek0CwUxE','Waste of resources w.r.t. Society ','> We wanted flying cars but got 140 characters. — Peter Thiel\n\nIs Twitter, Instagram, Netflix, or even feminism useless waste of resources and time? I\'d like to think that\'s not the case\n\n#Feminism in tech is not a waste of resources. Currently, it\'s a male dominated field, and if we can get the remaining 50% of the population to learn computer science, we can increase the technology output by a lot. It could be an 100% increase in work force in tech, if the field had no bias toward women. Does not seem like a trivial useless thing at all. Rather a very, very good thing. We should encourage women to do great things, this will increase our innovation as a country. What good does it do to stop 50% of our population to stay at home or take the non-lucrative jobs that doesn\'t contribute much to society?\n\nAnother argument on feminism that they only want good jobs, well that\'s not a surprise. And it\'s a good thing, it\'s good that they want to contribute to society, how is that bad? It\'s partly because men want a less competitive field. Giving them an easier time is not unfair, rather, they\'ve been treated unfairly all this time s.t. it\'s impossible to make it fair at once. That\'s why they kind of need a head start. They should in the end still be judged fairly among all \"contestants\" though.\n\nI don\'t think that women inherently don\'t want fulfilling jobs. Everyone wants a fulfilling life, and so too does women. Who doesn\'t want a job where you sit and code and earn hundreds of thousands of dollars every year? It became this way in the first place because of bias, not because of what they really want. Men didn\'t like pink in the way that we inherently don\'t like it, but also because of how society says we shouldn\'t like it. It\'s a thing that can change. And it\'s a good change if we can get women to work in tech. It\'s a valuable field for society.\n\nIs #twitter a waste of resources then? Or Instagram? I don\'t think so. Of course we can always say this argument to almost everything excluding the most efficient thing to do. But reality is not that simple.  \nFirstly, we don\'t know what is the right field to invest in. Computers seemed like a joke but has changed the world. How valuable is feminism, or will be? It\'s hard to know. Of course one can argue that we put *way too much* resources in feminism, that is a reasonable and very likely. But to get innovation, it\'s not about putting all your eggs in one basket. You diversify and try many things, and some hits is enough. I think? Not sure. How should society invest their resources?

Nothing. The cons exists for pointing out minor flaws though, it\'s not that socially accepted. You\'re supposed to hold a social standard or contract when interacting with other people.

You won\'t see many people that will talk about math, datascience or biology with the same confidence [1]. The entry-bar for political discussion is very low, and I pro-actively avoid giving my opinion on politics because I know for sure I\'m wrong in many places. It\'s not that I don\'t want to say my opinion, I sometimes do. It\'s just that I make sure I say with confidence that I\'m wrong with many problems and solutions. When I know I\'m wrong, I usually do not change my view to the inverse, but choose to throw away my opinion to become neutral and gradually converge to some standpoint.\n\nBut let\'s not stray too far from the main topic, I cut out politics because the cons outweigh the pros way too much. I have not become happier or much smarter because of politics, but rather the opposite. I do value politics, whether it\'s to make changes or fight absurdity to not repeat tragedies. The problem is that I have become very _paranoid_ that it\'s not worth it anymore.\n\nI\'m not and have never been a force of nature in politics, but always more of a standby-er (which most of us are). Instead I have chosen to double-down on other important problems that we face. Not everyone can be equally engaged in politics or should need too.\n\n[1]: From Paul Graham, good read.

As in morally, for society and all of those relevant questions.\n\nProstitution is more stigmatized than it actually is. What harm does it *really* do to society? Not much to be honest. It just people that are too biased towards prostitution, not that it\'s necessarily their fault. I mean we all have our own biases, it\'s hard to be perfectly bias less. I once had a negative view on prostitution too, while now I\'m more neutral towards it. It has it\'s drawbacks but also it\'s upside. Upside does not necessarily mean contribute huge positive contribution to society either, it can mean freedom of selling their body.\n\nBut whether it should be legal is another question that I won\'t try to answer. There\'s much that can happen if it does become legal, I\'m not sure how to answer this.\n\nMy own bias towards prostitution has led me to believe strongly that I have many other biases that I have not noticed and have a hard time noticing. I must be more observant on myself. Expect an entry on biases sometime in the future.','2017-12-06 21:13:49',1);
